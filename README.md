Landing Page Project for The Odin Project 

My first larger project to display the skills I have learned in HTML and CSS. Although front-end design is not my focus, it was refreshing to apply design skills and learn how to use Flexbox. This background will be very helpful as I continue to build my personal project and I am looking forward to digging into the back-end portion of TOP!
